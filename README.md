# Effect Attio SDK

A strongly-typed, schema-driven SDK for the [Attio REST API](https://docs.attio.com/rest-api/overview) based on [Effect](https://effect.website)'s `HttpClient`

This is highly experimental and not yet ready for production use. Lot of the code can be improved, a few API calls are still missing and errors are not fully typed yet. (see issues)
